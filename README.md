## Relevant geospatial lists

| Name | GitHub Repository | Description |
|:--------------------:|:-----------------------:|:-----------------:|
|Awesome Geospatial| <a href="https://github.com/sacridini/Awesome-Geospatial" target="_blank">GitHub link</a> | Long list of geospatial analysis tools. Geospatial analysis, or just spatial analysis, is an approach to applying statistical analysis and other analytic techniques to data which has a geographical or spatial aspect. |
|satellite-image-deep-learning| <a href="https://github.com/robmarkcole/satellite-image-deep-learning" target="_blank">GitHub link</a> | This repository lists resources on the topic of deep learning applied to satellite and aerial imagery. To a lesser extent classical machine learning techniques are listed, as are topics such as cloud computing and model deployment. |
